# react-native-camera-photos-access-example

- This project shows an example of how one can use camera and photos in react native apps.

- Uses react native CameraRoll api to access photos and react-native-camera npm package for accessing camera.

- It can be easily used in any project by just updating the styles as per your needs.

- I am passing state into every component back and forth right now to maintain the state for the app. But a better state management tool like Redux or flux is good to use. It is out of the scope of this project.

- For camera there is functionality for flash mode on/off/auto and switching between front/rear camera.

- Right now I have added the support for portrait and Landscape Right Orientation.

- So far I have tested this on IOS and it works perfectly fine.

- Working on android and creating a video to show how the module looks like.
