# react-native-camera-photos-access-example

This is project shows an example of how we can access camera and photos in react native apps.

It can be easily used in any project by just updating the styles as per your needs.

Right now I have added the support for portrait and Landscape Right Orientation

So far I have tested this on IOS and it works perfectly fine.

Working on android and creating a video to show how the module looks like.

## Run the project locally

```
npm install

react-native link  //link native dependencies

react-native run ios
```
