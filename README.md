# react-native-camera-photos-access-example

- This project shows an example of how we can access camera and photos in react native apps.

- Uses react native CameraRoll api to access photos and react-native-camera package for accessing camera.

- It can be easily used in any project by just updating the styles as per your needs.

- Right now I have added the support for portrait and Landscape Right Orientation

- So far I have tested this on IOS and it works perfectly fine.

- Working on android and creating a video to show how the module looks like.

## Run the project locally
